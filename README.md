# SkillHub — Backend

A backend REST API for the **SkillHub application**.  
This server manages skill-related data and provides endpoints that can be consumed by a frontend client.

The backend is built using **Node.js and Express**, following a simple and clear structure suitable for learning and extension.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The **SkillHub Backend** is responsible for:

- Handling skill data storage
- Retrieving skill-related information
- Managing API requests from the frontend
- Acting as the data layer of the SkillHub platform

It is designed to work alongside a React-based frontend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime  
- **Express.js** — Backend framework  
- **MongoDB** — Database for storing skill data  
- **Mongoose** — MongoDB object modeling  
- **dotenv** — Environment variable management  
- **CORS** — Cross-origin request handling

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the backend locally.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/patel192/Skillhub-backend.git
cd Skillhub-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:

env
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

### 4. Start the server
```bash
npm start
```
or (if using nodemon):

```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will run on:

arduino
```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🔗 API Endpoints (Example)

> Endpoint names may vary based on implementation.

| Method | Endpoint          | Description        |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|
| GET  | /api/skills       | Fetch all skills   |
| POST | /api/skills       | Add a new skill    |
| PUT  | /api/skills/:id   | Update a skill     |
| DELETE | /api/skills/:id | Delete a skill     |

All endpoints accept and return **JSON**.

## 🌐 Frontend Integration

This backend is designed to work with the **SkillHub frontend** built using React.

### Ensure:
- The correct API base URL is configured in the frontend  
- CORS is enabled on the backend  
- Requests are sent in JSON format  

---

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the API using:

- Postman  
- Thunder Client (VS Code extension)

Send **JSON payloads** to the defined endpoints to verify responses.

## 💡 Possible Enhancements

Future improvements may include:

- User authentication (JWT)
- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- Pagination and filtering
- Improved error handling and logging
